                <legend>What is hepatitis B?</legend>
                <p>
                    Hepatitis B is a serious infection that affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus.
                     <li>In 2009, about 38,000 people became infected with hepatitis B</li>
                <li>Each year about 2,000 to 4,000 people die in the United States from cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by hepatitis B.</li>
                </p>
                <p>Hepatitis B can cause:<br></br>
                <p><b>Acute (short-term) illness.</b> This can lead to:</p>
                <li>loss of appetite</li>
                <li>tiredness</li>
                <li>pain in muscles, joints, and stomach</li>
                <li>diarrhea and vomiting</li>
                <li>jaundice (yellow skin or eyes)</li>
                Acute illness, with symptoms, is more common among adults. Children who become infected usually do not have symptoms.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Chronic (long-term) infection.</b>Some people go on to develop chronic hepatitis B infection. Most of them do not have symptoms, but the infection is still very serious, and can lead to:
                <li>liver damage (cirrhosis)</li>
                <li>liver cancer</li>
                <li>death</li>
                </p>

                    <legend>Hepatitis B vaccine: Why get vaccinated?</legend>
                    <p>
                        Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, and the serious consequences of hepatitis B infection, including liver cancer and cirrhosis.
                    </p><p>   </br>Hepatitis B vaccine may be given by itself or in the same shot with other vaccines.
                    </p><p>    </br>Routine hepatitis B vaccination was recommended for some U.S. adults and children beginning in 1982, and for all children in 1991. Since 1990, new hepatitis B infections among children and adolescents have dropped by more than 95% – and by 75% in other age groups.
                      </p><p>  </br>Vaccination gives long-term protection from hepatitis B infection, possibly lifelong.

                    <legend>Who should get hepatitis B vaccine and when?</legend>
                    <p><b>Children and adolescents</b>
                    <li>Babies normally get 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine:
                    <li>1st Dose: Birth</li>
                    <li>2nd Dose: 1-2 months of age</li>
                    <li>3rd Dose: 6-18 months of age?</li></li>
                </br>Some babies might get 4 doses, for example, if a combination vaccine containing hepatitis B is used. (This is a single shot containing several vaccines.) The extra dose is not harmful.
                <li>Anyone through 18 years of age who didn't get the vaccine when they were younger should also be vaccinated.</li>
        </p>
        <p><b>Adults</b>
        <li>All unvaccinated adults at risk for hepatitis B infection should be vaccinated. This includes:

<li>people who inject street drugs,</li>
<li>people with chronic liver or kidney disease,</li>
<li>people under 60 years of age with diabetes,</li>
<li>people with jobs that expose them to human blood or other body fluids,</li>
<li>household contacts of people infected with hepatitis B,</li>
<li>residents and staff in institutions for the developmentally disabled,</li>
<li>kidney dialysis patients,</li>
<li>people who travel to countries where hepatitis B is common,</li>
<li>people with HIV infection.</li>
</li>Other people may be encouraged by their doctor to get hepatitis B vaccine; for example, adults 60 and older with diabetes. Anyone else who wants to be protected from hepatitis B infection may get the vaccine.</li>
<li>Pregnant women who are at risk for one of the reasons stated above should be vaccinated. Other pregnant women who want protection may be vaccinated.</li>
Adults getting hepatitis B vaccine should get 3 doses — with the second dose given 4 weeks after the first and the third dose 5 months after the second. Your doctor can tell you about other dosing schedules that might be used in certain circumstances.

                <fieldset>
                    <legend>Who should not get hepatitis B vaccine?</legend>
                    <p>
                    <li>Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to yeast, or to any other component of the vaccine, should not get hepatitis B vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.</li>
<li>Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine should not get another dose.</li>
<li>Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine.</li>
</br> Your doctor can give you more information about these precautions.</p>
